 HashTable.h/cpp Purpose: 
To implement an efficient open hash table that maps any two generic data types into
a data structure called a "node". The HashMap has the ability to keep track of what
was most recently inserted or updated in a recently-written list by "touching" chosen
data. Each mapped data has an option of "permanence" which allows or disallows that 
piece of data to be kept track of.
